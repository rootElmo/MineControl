# MineControl

This is a script I made in 2019 for a school project. We had the liberty to choose something to manage with Linux and I chose to make a Minecraft server with a small script controlling it

## Why the script?

The script was made to avoid constant switching between tmux-screens and to generally make the whole server upkeep more user friendly. The issue was that if I had the server running on a VPS, as soon as I logged out/lost connection, the server process would stop.

## To-do:

* Fix possibly infinite 'while'-loops with some sort of time-out
